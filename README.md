# Project Overview

This song, Small Worlds by Mac Miller, focuses on the nuance of human existence. He speaks about our limited time as living beings on earth, and puts into perspective how some of our greatest worries are relatively small in the grand scheme of things. While this may come across as a discouraging message, I believe that his subtle addressing of nihilistic themes creates a feeling of community in the sense that we, the listeners, are not the only ones who have these thoughts of existentialism at such a young age. Miller takes our bitter morality as motivation to continue trying, because regardless how many times you may fail "do you want it all if it's all mediocre?". We're all striving to be our best, to reach our potential and to enjoy what we've got while we still have it--because we never know when it'll all be gone.
