        <br>Yeah, nine times out of ten, I get it wrong <br>
        <br>Thatâ€™s why I wrote this song, told myself to hold on <br>
        <br>I can feel my fingers slippin' <br>
        <br>In a motherfuckin' instant, I'll be gone <br>
        <br>Do you want it all if it's all mediocre? <br>
        <br>Starin' at the wall and the wall's full of posters <br>
        <br>Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be <br>
        <br>I guess you gotta see it to believe <br>
